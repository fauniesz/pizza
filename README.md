Description

This is a website for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, onions, pineapple and sausage) and a size to order a pizza and see the final cost.

I use HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JQuery, Objected Oriented JavaScript.

Big thanks to my friend Eli Duke for helping me when I got super dooper stuck mid way through and was about to lose my entire mind!

Specifications

The user can enter what type or pizza they want, what size and the option to add another order. Once submitted they have the option for delivery.

Known Bugs

Once user chooses delivery option, it does not return their address. I had a lot of trouble getting this to work.
